Here comes another Ludam Dare :) . This is a project I worked on for the Ludum Dare 37 with the theme of â€œOne Roomâ€. Here it is a management game where you buy and put things on the tables to sell your goods at higher prices from the supplier :P</p>

I unfortunately didnâ€™t go through my entire list of ToDoâ€™s: http://pastebin.com/A79gSzT1 There were no animations added, and there where a lot of features programmed (personalites, occupaction, age, ect) that was not in the final build. But that is the nature of programming in ludum dare.</p>

But it works quite well (aside from the web version), just doesnâ€™t have an end goal, but still a fun concept.</p>

<p>From this Ludam Dare, Iâ€™ve learned a very important lesson. Donâ€™t spend time planning for most of the jam (woops) and donâ€™t write useless unwanted code. Iâ€™ve programmed a lot of things for the AI that didnâ€™t get used. I need to prioritize the base game then add all the goodies later.</p>
